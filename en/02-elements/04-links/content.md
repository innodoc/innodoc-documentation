---

There are different ways to insert links. Single words, parts of a sentence
and also [images]{data-link-section="02-elements/07-media"} can be turned into
links.

There is a distinction between external and internal links. Internal links
refer to positions or chapters within the course, while external links refer to
third-party websites.
