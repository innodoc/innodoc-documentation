title: Checkbox
---

Another type of exercise is the checkbox or *multiple response* task. Several
selectable options are presented where zero, one or multiple can be correct.

Checkbox exercises have several questions of type `checkbox`. One for each
checkbox that is displayed.

At the beginning, the checkbox are not filled in, i. e. meaning neither
selected nor not selected.

<Exercise>
  Are the following inequalities true or false?

  <Grid>
    <GridItem xs="4">
      []{.question .checkbox #EX_CB_1 solution="0" validation="boolean"}
    </GridItem>
    <GridItem xs="8">
      $\frac12>1-\frac13$
    </GridItem>
    <GridItem xs="4">
      []{.question .checkbox #EX_CB_2 solution="1" validation="boolean"}
    </GridItem>
    <GridItem xs="8">
      $a^2\geq 2a b-b^2$ (where $a$ and $b$ are unknown numbers)
    </GridItem>
    <GridItem xs="4">
      []{.question .checkbox #EX_CB_3 solution="1" validation="boolean"}
    </GridItem>
    <GridItem xs="8">
      $\frac12<\frac23<\frac34$
    </GridItem>
