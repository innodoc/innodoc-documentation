It is obviously also possible to represent lists:

- lists are useful
- they create a clear and readable structure
- lists can be used in many ways
- ...

Similarly to just bullet lists it's also possible to have enumerated lists:

1. enumerations are useful too
2. they create a clear and readable structure
3. enumerations are equally flexible

It's also possible to mix the two structures:

1. combined approaches are even more useful!
  - they can be more flexible
  - they can represent ideas better
2. they create a readable structure
  1. whith good structure
  2. with sublists
    1. Which can have sublists themselves!
3. and much more!
