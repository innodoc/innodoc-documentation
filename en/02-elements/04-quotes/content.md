a further provided function is the ability to quote:

> Research is what I'm doing when I don't know what I'm doing.

Quotes can also be multi-line:

> This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the
> beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying
> for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and
> you call us criminals.  We explore... and you call us criminals.  We seek
> after knowledge... and you call us criminals.  We exist without skin color,
> without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.
> You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us
> and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.

It's also possible to have quotes with arbitrary newlines:

> Wer reitet so spät durch Nacht und Wind?
> Es ist der Vater mit seinem Kind.
> Er hat den Knaben wohl in dem Arm,
> Er faßt ihn sicher, er hält ihn warm.
