title: Links
---

To insert links, the following format is used: `[LINK TEXT](TARGET)`.

The link text can consist of any inline elements, such as [formatted
text](app:section|02-elements/01-basics#formatting),
[formulas](app:section|02-elements/03-formulas), or even
[images](app:section|02-elements/04-media).

A distinction is made between *internal* and *external* links. [Internal
links](app:section|02-elements/02-links/01-internal) refer to content within a
course or pages such as the homepage or the glossary. [External
links](app:section|02-elements/02-links/02-external) allow references to other
websites outside of this course.
