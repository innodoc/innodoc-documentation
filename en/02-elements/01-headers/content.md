title: Headers
---

With the innoConv-converter it's possible to subdivide any single page in
additional sections by using headers.

Clearly it's also possible to structure a block of text just by subdivinding
it in paragraphs.

# First order header

This is how a first order header looks - but of course it's possible to have
further subdivisions.

## Second order header

The second subdivision layer can be be subdivided too:

### Third order header

It's not recommended to have more then three steps of subdivision in one
document.

### Further third order heading

Of course one it's possible to have multiple headings of the same order

## Further second order heading

It's also possible to jump back to headings of higher order anytime

## Third second order heading


### Duis in Praesent

It's also possible to have empty headings

# Wieder erste Ordnung


### Quisque tortor

Duis risus mi, vestibulum et molestie ut, elementum et leo. Quisque tortor lorem, mollis sit amet eros et, placerat egestas ligula.


# Decidit causam mirabilis dapes
