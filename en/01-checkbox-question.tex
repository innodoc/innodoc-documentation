A sample checkbox exercise including the solution and correct answers.

\begin{MExercise}
Are the following inequalities true or false?

\begin{MQuestionGroup}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
\MLCheckbox{0}{UG1} & \ \ &  $\frac12>1-\frac13$\\
\MLCheckbox{1}{UG2} & \ \ & $a^2\geq 2a b-b^2$ (where $a$ and $b$ are unknown numbers)\\
\MLCheckbox{1}{UG3} & \ \ & $\frac12<\frac23<\frac34$\\
\MLCheckbox{0}{UG4} & \ \ & Let $a<b$, then also $a^2<b^2$.
\end{tabular}
\end{MQuestionGroup}
\MGroupButton{Check input}

\begin{MHint}{Solution}
The first inequality can be simplified to $\frac12>\frac23$, which, after multiplying by $6$,
is equivalent to $3>4$. This statement is false. The second inequality can be simplified by
collecting all numbers on the left-hand side: $a^2-2a b+b^2\geq 0$. Since $a^2-2a b+b^2=(a-b)^2$,
this statement is true for all $a$ and $b$. Multiplying the third chain of inequalities by the
least common denominator $12$ results in the chain of inequalities $6<8<9$. This statement is true.
In contrast, the last statement is false, since for example, for $a=-1$ and $b=1$, the term
$a^2=1$ is not less than $b^2=1$. Taking the square of terms is not an equivalent transformation.
