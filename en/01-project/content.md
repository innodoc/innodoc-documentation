title: Project structure
---

A course consists of a number of chapters, sections and subsections. Also it
can contain a number of additional pages to add content like list of authors
or license information.

All content is written using the [Markdown format]{data-index-term="Markdown"}.
A file [`content.md`](/section/01-project/02-files/02-content) is created in
a specific folder. Also static files, like images and videos can be included.
