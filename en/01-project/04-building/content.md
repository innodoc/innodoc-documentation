In order to view and use a course it needs to be compiled into an intermediate
format which is accepted by the viewer programs. Also graphics are translated
and an index and table of contents are generated.

The program
[[innoConv](https://github.com/innodoc/innoconv)]{data-index-term="innoConv"}
is used to convert content to the intermediate format.

<Info>
  Have a look at the [innoConv documentation](https://innoconv.readthedocs.io/).
