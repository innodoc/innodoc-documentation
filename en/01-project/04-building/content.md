In order to view and use a course it needs to be compiled into an intermediate
format which is accepted by the viewer programs. Also graphics are being
translated and an index and table of contents are generated.

The program
[[innoConv](https://github.com/innodoc/innoconv)]{data-index-term="innoConv"}
does capable of this job and also comes with its own
[documentation](https://innoconv.readthedocs.io/).
